## Empty BE Project For Sourcery Academy 2025 Spring

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 JDK installed. [Link](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jdk&arch=x64&os=windows)

### Setup

To compile you need an environment variable in `.env`.
You can find it in discord `#secrets` channel.

```
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=${code-from-discord}
```

### Endpoints

They can be seen in Swagger using the following link:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/swagger-ui/index.html
```

They can also be seen in Intellij run -> Mappings and in Postman collection provided in `postman` folder

**It's recommended to use built-in Intellij tools to run/build the app**

Command line operation:

- Start the App: `./gradlew bootRun`
- Run tests: `./gradlew test`
- Build the App: `./gradlew build`

‚úÖ Azurite (Azure Storage Emulator)

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Stop Containers**

docker-compose down
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Check Logs**

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Static Analysis Tools

This project is configured with Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs for static code analysis.

### Running Static Analysis

You can run all static analysis checks using:

```sh
./gradlew check
```

This will execute:

- Checkstyle: Ensures code style consistency.
- PMD: Detects potential bugs and bad practices.
- SpotBugs: Finds security and performance issues.

To run them individually:

- Checkstyle: `./gradlew checkstyleMain`
- PMD: `./gradlew pmdMain`
- SpotBugs: `./gradlew spotbugsMain`

## **üîí Secret variables**

All secret keys are in team's Discord server, `#secrets` channel

## Database

All migrations are stored in `src/main/resources/db/changelog/`. They will be run on application start.
To add a new migration change `db.changelog-master.yaml` to include the new file in `changes/` folder and write your sql
script.
An example is given in `changes/db.example.sql`

## Deployment

To setup manual deployment install Intellij Azure plugin and import from `.run/` folder the run command.
Then fill it up from the discord `#secrets` channel.
To deploy you will need an Azure account. After creaton ask Renaldas to add you to the resource group.
